Warning: Some reactions were missed because reaction probability exceeded 1.
  Ca[1] + SERCA_X1[1]  --  62.889% of reactions missed.
  Ca[1] + SERCA_X1A[1]  --  25.013% of reactions missed.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of PMCA_2 was 9.99983 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.

iterations = 1000000 ; elapsed time = 1 seconds
